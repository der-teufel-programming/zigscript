# zigscript

A companion scripting language for Zig developers.

This is an exploration on a scripting language whose goals are to:

1) be as easy/fast to write as python
2) be seamless for Zig developers to write

I'm starting out this experiment by first implementing an interpreter for Zig based on
the Zig grammar.  With this in place, I'll be looking into ways I can enhance the
syntax to take advantage of new "script-like" features such as automatic memory
management and builtin data structures like map/list.
